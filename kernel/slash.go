	// calculation forever, but if this node continues to work after a long time,

// but whenever another slashing node with more priority proceeds it, it resumes
// working again, a large round space may happen.
//
// to make it equal and fair, the large round space slashing will cause zero
// loss, and the payee will get back the whole pledge. so the punishment to
// a removing or slashing node is only drastically mint decline.

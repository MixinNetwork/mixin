# Mixin Kernel Snapshots

Snapshot is the core of all Mixin Kernel stuffs, the Mixin Kernel BFT consensus operates on snapshots.

The current Kernel snapshot version is `0x01`, which is marshaled as a special msgpack format [https://github.com/MixinNetwork/msgpack](https://github.com/MixinNetwork/msgpack) before the snapshot hash calculation.

All snapshot-related API exposed externally have and should always have a consistent JSON representation as below.

```json

```

- **hash**: HEX representation of a 32 bytes hash, which is the unique snapshot identifier.

- **node**: HEX representation of a 32 bytes hash, which is the node id which leads this snapshot.

- **references**: the previous round hashes of the leading node and another node conforms to the consensus.

- **round**: a uint64 round number of this snapshot, round is similar to the block of Bitcoin.

- **timestamp**: a uint64 nanosecond since Unix epoch, which is provided by the leading node and agreed upon consensus.

- **topology**: a uint64 number as the snapshot order in all snapshots, this value is the only node-provided value, **NOT** included in the hash and not agreed by consensus.

- **transaction**: HEX representation of a 32 bytes hash, which is the transaction hash included by this snapshot.

- **version**: a uint8 number to hint the current snapshot format.
